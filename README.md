## About

The LittleRP2 is the an update to the LittleRP Open Source Resin Printer (http://www.littlerp.com) that adds additional functionality as well as refinements. Some of the primary differences between the LittleRP and the LittleRP2 are:

#### Harder to find parts available in the LittleRP web store: (http://littlerp.bigcartel.com)

### Flexibilty:
- Wider foodprint to allow for additional vat options
- Self-sourceable configurable vat
- Extended height option
- Convertable to larger build area
- Additional controller shield options
- Additional supported projectors
- MGN12 rail option
- TR8x2 Leadscrew option
- Rear shutter access added
- Common vat nut-trap holddowns

### Refinement
- Quiet operation (using TMC2100 drivers and Astrosyn dampner)
- Hinged hood
- Bent non-glued hood option
- Solid build plate
- Z-limit switch
- Stepper driven shutter / limit switch option
- Sockethead adjustment for build plate leveling
- Increased rigidity of top panel attachment

### Greater Precision and Print Quality
- 25 Micron X/Y options for Acer X152H and Optoma HD37 projectors.
- Astrosyn dampner decouples leadscrew non-eccentricity.

## Build Size:
Dimensions vary depending on selected projector but typically projection sizes for the standard height LittleRP2 are:

X: 60-72mm / 110-120mm (w/ Extended Build Area Addon)
Y: 42-45mm / 70-75mm (w/ Extended Build Area Addon)
Z: 100mm / 200mm (w/ Extended Height Version)

(Build size is now expandable up to 120mm (x) 80mm (y) with the new Extended Build Area Addon).
