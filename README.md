## About

The LittleRP2 is the an update to the LittleRP Open Source Resin Printer that adds additional functionality as well as refinements. Some of the primary differences between the LittleRP and the LittleRP2 are:

### Flexibilty:
- Wider foodprint to allow for additional vat options
- Self-sourceable configurable vat
- Extended height option
- Convertable to larger build area
- Additional controller shield options
- Additional supported projectors
- MGN12 rail option
- TR8x2 Leadscrew option
- Rear shutter access added
- Common vat nut-trap holddowns

### Refinement
- Quiet operation (using TMC2100 drivers and Astrosyn dampner)
- Hinged hood
- Bent non-glued hood option
- Solid build plate
- Z-limit switch
- Stepper driven shutter / limit switch option
- Sockethead adjustment for build plate leveling
- Increased rigidity of top panel attachment

### Greater Precision and Print Quality
- 25 Micron X/Y options for Acer X152H and Optoma HD37 projectors.
- Astrosyn dampner decouples leadscrew non-eccentricity.
